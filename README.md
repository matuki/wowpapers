This is a simple project I use to exercise and study Android development.
My plan is to keep contributing to it constantly and add features, improve current implementation and test new frameworks.
The app enables user to list and apply smartphone-compatible wallpapers available on Wallhaven.cc's open API (https://wallhaven.cc/help/api).

List of libs and frameworks used so far:

- Toothpick (DI)
- Coroutines (Async)
- Room DB
- Retrofit

Architecture Practices and Patterns the project aims to follow:

- Clean Architecture
- Modularization (a simple approach)
- MVVM

Upcoming planned additions:

- Flow
- Coroutines
- RxJava
